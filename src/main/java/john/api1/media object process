Media load strategy.

Pre-signed URL
Expires every 1 hour
Auto generate every expired

Store to Redis
Pre-signed URl
and media Id

If Expired (every 1h before 10m)
Quietly call api to refresh
Update redis with new url
Update current metadata?

Frontend POV
Load media with pre-signed urls
Call api to fetch more data?
